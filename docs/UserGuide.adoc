== Introduction

Notably is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing notes*. More importantly, Notably is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Notably can get your notes taken down faster than traditional GUI apps.

=== An Introduction to Notably
The image shown below highlights the different sections of Notably's user interface:

=== Symbols used in this guide
[NOTE]
Denotes something that you may want to take note of.
[TIP]
Denotes something that may be helpful if you are having any difficulties.
[WARNING]
Denotes a warning for something critical.

== Getting started

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `notably.jar`
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your notes.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The Application should start in a few seconds.
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

== Features

====
*Command Legend*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `open NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `open Notably`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `-t TITLE [-b BODY]` can be used as `-t Notably -b Lorem ipsum` or as `-t Notably`.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `-t TITLE -b BODY`, `-b BODY -t TITLE` is also acceptable.
====

====
*Paths*

* `Paths` are used to specify the directory you want to `Commands` to be executed.
* There are 2 types of  `Path` namely:
- AbsolutePath (Take reference from the root)
- RelativePath (Take reference from the current directory)

The Relative Path operate similar to the command line input that you may be familiar with.
Listed below are the notations used to define a relative path.

* `..` (Move to parent note)
* `exampleNote` (Move to child node titled "exampleNote")

[NOTE]
The title of a Note can take in alphanumeric variables and spaces.

**Example**

The picture below helps to illustrate the use of `RelativePath` and `AbsolutePath`

.DataStructure example to illustrate Path
image::PathExample1.png[width="790"]

The `AbsolutePath` `/CS2101` is equivalent to `RelativePath` `../2101`

Thus `open /CS2101` and `open ../CS2101` would yield the same result.

[NOTE]
Paths are used by the `open` and `delete` command

[WARNING]
We cannot open or delete the parent of the root note because it does not exist. e.g `Delete /../` will result in an error.
====
=== View help : `help`

Notably will display the list of features and commands available as well as their uses. +
Format: `help`

.Demo for the `help` command

=== Exit the program: `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

.Demo for the `exit` command
image:demo/Exit.png[]

=== Create a new note: `new`

You can create a new note in your current working directory. +
Format: `new -t TITLE [-b BODY] [-o]` +
Example: `new -t Notably -b Lorem ipsum dolor sit amer -o`

.Demo for the `new` command (with all parameters)
image:demo/New1.png[]

.Demo for the `new` command (with only title parameter)
image:demo/New2.png[]

.Demo for the `new` command (after new note creations)
image:demo/New3.png[]

=== Open an existing note: `open`

You can open an existing note by specifynig its title. A slash `/` character can be used to denote a filesystem-like hierarchy. +
Format: `open [-t] TITLE` +
Example: `open -t Notably/CS2103`

.Demo for the `open` command (with suggestions)
image:demo/Open.png[]

=== Edit an existing note: `edit`

Edits body paragraph of the current note. This command replaces the current content of a note with the newly specified body. +
Format: `edit -b BODY`
Example: `edit -b This is the new body paragraph`

.Demo for the `edit` command
image:demo/Edit1.png[]

.Demo for the `edit` command (after edit)
image:demo/Edit2.png[]

=== Find a note based on certain keywords: `search`

Searches all the notes saved in Notably for the keyword. +
Format: `search [-s] KEYWORD` +
Example: `search -s CS2103`

.Demo for the `search` command
image:demo/Search.png[]

=== Delete a note: `delete`

If you no longer need a note, or accidentally create a wrong one, don't worry. You can always delete your note. A slash `/` character can be used to denote a filesystem-like hierarchy. +
Format: `delete [-t] TITLE` +
Example: `delete -t Notably/CS2103`

[IMPORTANT]
If your target path is a subtree, the whole subtree including the child would be deleted.

.Demo for the delete command (before deletion)
image::/demo/Delete1.png[width="790"]

.Demo for the delete command (after deletion)
image::/demo/Delete2.png[width="790"]

[NOTE]
You can achieve the same result by using a `AbsolutePath` instead. `delete -t /Workspace/Notably`


=== Save the data

Notes data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

=== Auto suggestions

Suggestions will be provided as commands are being filled in. For clarity, see the mockups below.

.Demo for the suggestions feature
image:demo/Suggestions.png[]

=== Auto correct

Mistypes, as long as they are not too far away from available commands, will be accepted. This will give the user a more fluid typing experience.
