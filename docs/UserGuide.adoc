Introduction

Notably is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for taking notes. More importantly, Notably is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Notably can get your notes taken down faster than traditional GUI apps.

Quick Start

Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.
Download the latest addressbook.jar https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-2/main/releases
Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Notably.
Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. For example, typing help and pressing Enter will open the help window.
Some example commands you can try:
list : lists all contacts
add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
delete 3 : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
exit : exits the app

Command Format
Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user. For example, in add n/NAME, NAME is a parameter that can be used as add n/John Doe.
Items in square brackets are optional e.g n/NAME [t/TAG] can be used as n/John Doe t/friend or as n/John Doe.
Items with “…”​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times. For example, [t/TAG]... can be used as t/friend, t/friend t/family, etc.
Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER, p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME is also acceptable.
