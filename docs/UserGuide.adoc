By: `Team Notably`      Since: `Feb 2020`      Licence: `MIT`

== Introduction

Notably is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing notes*. More importantly, Notably is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Notably can get your notes taken down faster than traditional GUI apps.

=== An Introduction to Notably
The image shown below highlights the different sections of Notably's user interface:

.Notably GUI legends
image::Legends.png[width="900"]

=== Symbols used in this guide
[NOTE]
Denotes something that you may want to take note of.
[TIP]
Denotes something that may be helpful if you are having any difficulties.
[WARNING]
Denotes a warning for something critical.

== Getting started

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `notably.jar`
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your notes.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The Application should start in a few seconds.
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

== Features

====
*Command Legend*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `open NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `open Notably`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `open [-t] TITLE` can be used as `open -t TITLE` or as `open TITLE`, where `TITLE` is the title of the note.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `new -t TITLE [-o]`, `new [-o] -t TITLE` is also acceptable.
====
// tag::paths[]
[#paths]
====
*Paths*

* `Paths` are used to specify the location of a note you want the `Command` to be pointed at.
* There are 2 types of  `Path` namely:
- AbsolutePath (which takes reference from the root)
- RelativePath (which takes reference from the current note)

[NOTE]
`/` represents a root note

The `RelativePath` operates similarly to the command line input that you may be familiar with.
Listed below are the notations used to define a `RelativePath`.

* `.` (Point to current note)
* `..` (Point to parent note)
* `exampleNote` (Point to child node)

**Validity of Paths**

- AbsolutePath
** Must start with the root note.
** After every `/` you can provide a `Title` <<TitleValidity, (Valid Title)>>.
** `/Workspace/2103T` is a valid `AbsolutePath`, `Workspace/2103T` is not.

- Relative Path
** Starts with `.` or `..` or a Title <<TitleValidity, (Valid Title)>>.
** `./CS2103T/../CS2101`  is a valid `RelativePath`.

**Example**

The picture below helps to illustrate the use of `RelativePath` and `AbsolutePath`

.DataStructure example to illustrate Path
image::UGPathDiagram.png[width="790"]


The `AbsolutePath` `/Workspace/CS2101` is equivalent to `RelativePath` `../CS2101`

Thus `open /Workspace/CS2101` and `open ../CS2101` would yield the same result.

[NOTE]
Paths are used by the `open` and `delete` command

[WARNING]
We cannot open or delete the parent of the root note because it does not exist.
Taking example from Figure 2 above, `Delete ../..` will result in an error.
// end::paths[]
====

=== View help : `help`

If you can't remember the commands or you are unsure about what a particular command does, type `help` and hit kbd:[Enter]. Notably will show you a link to the list of the commands it has and what they do. +

*Format:* `help`

.Demo for the `help` command
image::demo/Help.png[]

=== Exit the program: `exit`

If you're done with taking notes, use `exit` to close Notably straight from the command line. +

*Format:* `exit`

.Demo for the `exit` command
image::demo/Exit.png[]

//tag::new[]
=== Create a new note: `new`

If you want to add a new note to the current working directory (currently opened note), use the `new` command and specify the `TITLE` of the note. +

*Format:* `new -t TITLE [-o]`

[[TitleValidity]]
[IMPORTANT]
====
* The `TITLE` for the note MUST be specified.
* The `TITLE` for the note can only contain alphabets, numbers, symbols (except ` and -) and whitespaces.
====

[TIP]
====
* Use the optional `-o` flag to immediately open the note after creating it.
====

==== Example: Creating new notes
. Let's first create a note (with a `TITLE`), and open it immediately after. <<New1, (Step 1)>> Type this command: +

    new -t Notably -o


. Now the currently open note is `Notably`. Let's add create a note to the currently opened note, <<New2, (Step 2)>> with a `TITLE` only as follows: +

    new -t CS2103T

. The new note `CS2103T` has been created successfully! <<New3, (Step 3)>> +

[NOTE]
====
Observe that the note `CS2103T` was not opened immediately
====
[[New1]]
.Step 1 - Demo for the `new` command (with the `open` flag)
image::demo/New1.png[Demo]
[[New2]]
.Step 2 - Demo for the `new` command (without the `open` flag)
image::demo/New2.png[]
[[New3]]
.Step 3 - Demo for the `new` command (after creating both notes)
image::demo/New3.png[]
//end:new[]

=== Open an existing note: `open`

You can open an existing note by specifying its title (and optionally with its absolute or relative <<paths, path>>). +

*Format:* `open [-t] [PATH/TO/]TITLE` +

[TIP]
====
* If you want to save some keypresses, omit the optional `-t` flag. It still works fine!
====

==== Example: Opening a note
. Let's open the note `Notably` that exists in the currently opened note `Workspace` <<Open, (Step 1)>> with the command: +

    open -t Notably

[NOTE]
====
* Notably gives you some useful suggestions on other paths that are similar or related to your input!
====
[[Open]]
.Step 1 - Demo for the `open` command (with suggestions)
image::demo/Open.png[]

=== Edit an existing note: `edit`

If you want to change the `BODY` content of the currently opened note, use the `edit` command. This command *opens* an editing window where you can update the existing `BODY` of the note.
*Format:* `edit`

[WARNING]
====
* You are not allowed to `edit` the root note, i.e the currently opened path is ``"/"``
====

==== Example: Editing the currently opened note
. Let's update the `BODY` content of the currently opened note `Workspace` with the command: +

    edit

.Demo for the `edit` command
image::demo/Edit.png[]

//tag:delete[]
=== Delete a note: `delete`

If you no longer need a note, or you accidentally created a wrong note, don't worry! You can always delete That note. A slash `/` character can be used to denote a filesystem-like hierarchy. +

*Format:* `delete [-t] [PATH/TO/]TITLE`

[WARNING]
====
* Deleting a note will also delete its child notes. Be very careful! You can refer to the example below for an illustration
====

==== Example: Deleting an existing note
. Let's delete the `Notably` note using this command:

    delete -t Notably

[NOTE]
====
* `Another Note`, `CS2103` and `ST2334` are immediately deleted as well since they are child notes of `Notably`
* The above example uses `RelativePath`. You can achieve the same result as above by using an `AbsolutePath` instead by executing `delete -t /Workspace/Notably`.
====
.Demo for the `delete` command
image::demo/Delete1.png[]

.Demo for the `delete` command (after deletion)
image::demo/Delete2.png[]
//end::delete[]

=== Find a note based on certain keywords: `search`

If you need to look for a note that contains a specific keyword in its *content*, use the `search` command and Notably
will show you the search results sorted by the number of matches in the note. The note with the highest number of match will be
at the top of the list, so that you can access it faster. +
*Format:* `search [-s] KEYWORD`

[NOTE]
====
* `search` looks through *all* the notes that you have
* Partial matches work as well! It means that when you have a set of notes containing the word "lecture" but no "lect" as a word on its own,
you can just type `search lect` and Notably will still show you a list of notes containing the word "lecture", as "lect" is part of the word "lecture".
* Matches are case insensitive, meaning it will find the word no matter if it is in uppercase or lowercase or even mixed-case
====

==== Example: Searching for the keyword "Computer science"
Let's look for the keyword "Computer science" if it exists in any of the notes that you have saved in Notably. +

`search -s Computer science`

If the word "Computer science" exists, a list of suggestions will be generated. This list will be sorted in descending order
of the number of matches, i.e. the note with the highest number of matches will be at the top of the list, as seen in the figure below.

.Demo for the `search` command: keyword found
image::demo/Search.png[]

Let's say the first option `/Workspace/Notably/CS2103/Project` is the note you are looking for. You may press kbd:[↓] and kbd:[Enter]
to open the note. The figure below illustrates how the note chosen will be opened and the command line box is cleared.

.Demo for the `search` command: open a note with the searched keyword
image::demo/Search1.png[]

If the keyword you are looking for does not exist in any of your notes, no suggestions will be generated, as seen in the figure below.

.Demo for the `search` command: keyword not found
image::demo/Suggestions4.png[]

=== Save the data

Notes data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need for you to save manually.

=== Auto suggestions

As you type, Notably will provide you with suggestions. You can press the keyboard kbd:[↓] button followed by kbd:[Enter] to select any suggestion in the list.

For example, as you type `open -t Notably`, a list of suggestions will be generated as seen in the figure below.

.Demo for the suggestions feature: Suggestions are generated as the user keys in his input
image::demo/Suggestions.png[]

Let's say you would like to choose the option `/Workspace/Notably/Another Note`. After pressing kbd:[↓] to reach that suggestion
and pressing kbd:[Enter], the command input line will be auto-filled by the suggestion, as seen in the figure below.

.Demo for the suggestions feature: The user input is auto-completed when the user selects a suggestion
image::demo/Suggestions2.png[]

If no suggestion list is generated for the command `open`, `delete` or `search`, it means the path, title, or keyword cannot be found
anywhere in Notably, as seen in the figures below.

.Demo for the suggestions feature: The user inputs a path/ title that does not exist in his Notably app, thus no suggestion list is generated
image::demo/Suggestions3.png[]

.Demo for the suggestions feature: The user inputs a keyword that does not exist in any of his notes, thus no suggestion list is generated
image::demo/Suggestions4.png[]

==== (Coming in v2.0) Suggestion response text when opening or deleting a parent note
Variations of path with `../` (e.g. `open ../`, `open Note/../Note`, etc.) will not generate a comprehensive response text.
Currently, typing `open ../` will generate a response text of `Open a note titled "../"` instead of `Open a parent note`.

// tag::correction[]

=== Auto correction

Notably will try its best to correct your mistypes automatically, as long as your mistyped inputs are not too far away from the understood commands. This provides you with a more fluid typing experience!

Notably's auto correction feature works on two aspects of your typing:

. It auto corrects command names, where command names refers to `open`, `search`, `delete`, `edit`, and others. For example, Notably will correct the mistyped command name `opne` to `open`.
. It auto corrects the `Paths` of notes. For example, depending on the notes that exist in your database, Notably might correct `/Notaby` to `/Notably`.

See the example below for more information.

==== Example: Auto correcting user input

[NOTE]
Even though the user types in the command name `opne`, Notably is still able to recognise this as an `open` command. +
In addition, the inputted `RelativePath` `Notaby` is understood by Notably, even though there's no note in the database with the title `Notaby`. Instead, there exists a note in the database with the `RelativePath` `Notably`. +
After corrections are done, a list of suggestions will be generated as if the user has inputted `open -t Notably`!

.Demo for the auto correction feature
image::demo/Correction.png[]

// end::correction[]

=== Response text
Notably also displays a response text which enables you to understand the meaning of the input you type and shows
an error message when your input is invalid.

For example, if you type `open /CS`, the response text will indicates that you are trying to `Open a note titled "/CS"`,
as seen in the figure below.

.Demo for the response text feature: open command
image::demo/ResponseText1.png[]

On the other hand, if you key in an invalid command, the response text will display an error message as seen in the figure
below.

.Demo for the response text feature: invalid command

// tag::markdown[]

=== Markdown (GitHub Flavored Markdown)

[NOTE]
We use the term Markdown and GitHub Flavored Markdown interchangably in this document.

Notably supports basic https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/[GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)] as the `BODY` content of a note.
By supporting Markdown, we hope to enhance your typing experience even further. You can simply type your note in Markdown, and it'll take care of displaying the content of your note in a nice layout for you.

Currently supported syntax of GitHub Flavored Markdown in Notably consists of:

* https://github.github.com/gfm/#atx-heading[ATX headings] +
----
# Level 1 header
## Level 2 header
### Level 3 header
#### Level 4 header
##### Level 5 header
###### Level 6 header
----
* https://github.github.com/gfm/#list[Lists] and https://github.github.com/gfm/#list-items[List items] +
[IMPORTANT]
Currently, only unordered lists are supported. In addition, only the hyphen `-` symbol is supported to be used as the list bullets. +
----
- List item
- Another list item
  - A nested list item
    - A deeper nested list item
- Last list item
