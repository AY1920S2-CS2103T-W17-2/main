== PROJECT: Notably

---

== Overview

Notably is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing notes*. More importantly, Notably is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Notably can get your notes taken down faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *Notably's auto correction functionality*
** What it does: Allows Notably to understand mistyped commands from user, as long as it is within a certain configured threshold. This makes it possible for the user to type faster than before, as he/she does not need to worry about wrong spelling anymore.
** Justification: This feature improves user experience significantly, as it allows our users to type commands without worrying about wrong spelling any longer. This is really crucial, as Notably is a keyboard/CLI first note-taking application; most interactions are done via typing.
** Highlights:
*** This enhancement calls for good abstraction. Due to the fact that this component is used the suggestions generation and command parsing aspects of Notably, I had to come up with an abstraction that minimize code duplication and at the same time is flexible for future improvements.
*** In addition, this feature requires calculating https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance[edit distance]. This shows that I am able to incorporate and create suitable wrappers around complex algorithms to be used in a Software Engineering project.
** Credits: The implementation of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance[edit distance] algorithm is inspired by https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/lec/med.pdf.

* *Major enhancement*: Wrote *Notably's Markdown to HTML compiler*
** What it does: Allows Notably to compile Markdown into HTML.
** Justification: This feature improves user experience significantly, as it allows our users to format their notes using the Markdown syntax. This is really crucial, as Notably is a keyboard/CLI first note-taking application; GUI-based text formatting solution would not work well.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires me to learn basic compilation techniques, such as tokenizing, parsing, and target code generation. Although Markdown is not a complex syntax, building a Markdown to HTML compiler following the techniques prove to be quite challenging.
** Credits: The implementation of the compiler is inspired by https://github.github.com/gfm/#appendix-a-parsing-strategy.
