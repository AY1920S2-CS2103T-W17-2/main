== PROJECT: Notably

---

== Overview

Notably is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts*. More importantly, Notably is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Notably can get your notes taken down faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added Path and recreated Parser
** What it does: Handle all user input and make user experience as intuitive as possible.
** Justification: This feature boosts the productivity significantly because user can type less to achieve the same result. For example, the user can type `o cs2103T/tutorials/tutorial2` to open 3 nested blocks rather than typing 3 commands .
** Highlights: This enhancement recreates the whole parser to be more intuitive and similar to the terminal we are familiar with. It required an in-depth analysis of the existing design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required multiple new predicate and utility classes.
** Credits:

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Add optional Prefix to enhance user experience.
** Add shorthand for Commands to enhance user experience.
** Add Logger to parser and Command to help future development.
