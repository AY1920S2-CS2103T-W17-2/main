== PROJECT: Notably

---

== Overview

Notably is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts*. More importantly, Notably is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Notably can get your notes taken down faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added Parser and Command of the system.
** What it does: Integrate the features implemented by my team mate to one system and make sense of the user input.
** Justification: This enhancement improve the user experience and is crucial to detect and prevent any unintended changes.
** Highlights: This enhancement allow the user experience to be more intuitive and is designed similar to the terminal
that we are familiar with. It required an in-depth analysis of the existing design alternatives.
The implementation too was challenging as it required multiple new predicate and utility classes.

* *Major enhancement*: Path data structure.
** What it does: Allow the user different form of traversal methods (Either relative to the current directory or to the root).
** Justification: This feature boosts the productivity of the user significantly because user can type less to traverse into a block.
For example, the user can type `o cs2103T/tutorials/tutorial2` to open 3 nested blocks rather than typing 3 commands .
** Highlights: This enhancement allow the user experience to be more intuitive and is designed similar to the terminal
that we are familiar with. It required an in-depth analysis of the existing design alternatives.


* *Minor enhancement*:
** Add optional Prefix to enhance user experience.
** Tested the integrated features implemented by my group members.
** Add Logger to parser and Command to help future development.
